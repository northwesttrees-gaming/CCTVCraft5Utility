CCTVCraft Utility is a standalone expansion to CCTVCraft, adding a wide range of utility systems that support and extend the core mod. This mod was designed to be separate from the main project to allow easier maintenance of the core mod, while remaining an optional add-on for players who want additional features.

The primary goal of CCTVCraft Utility is to provide CCTVCraft with a custom-built energy, fluid, and item transport system, as well as multiple generation methods such as solar, coal, geothermal, and pump-based power and fluid sources.

Unlike traditional implementations, the energy and fluid systems in this mod are built entirely from the ground up, giving us full control and customization over their behavior. This approach removes reliance on NeoForge Energy or Fluid systems, which are limited within MCreator, allowing for more flexible and advanced functionality in future updates.
