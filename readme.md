CCTVCraft Utility is a standalone expansion to CCTVCraft, adding a wide range of utility systems that support and extend the core mod. This mod was designed to be separate from the main project to allow easier maintenance of the core mod, while remaining an optional add-on for players who want additional features.

The primary goal of CCTVCraft Utility is to provide CCTVCraft with a custom-built energy, fluid, and item transport system, as well as multiple generation methods such as solar, coal, geothermal, and pump-based power and fluid sources.

Unlike traditional implementations, the energy and fluid systems in this mod are built entirely from the ground up, giving us full control and customization over their behavior. This approach removes reliance on NeoForge Energy or Fluid systems, which are limited within MCreator, allowing for more flexible and advanced functionality in future updates.

|  | **NBT Variables:** Core energy and fluid data are stored using NeoForge NBT variables, handling essential properties such as storage, maximum send, maximum receive, and maximum capacity. This ensures consistent and reliable data management across all utility-based blocks and systems. |
| ![Grid Classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/northwesttrees-gaming/CCTVCraft5Utility/refs/heads/main/modpages/github/github_icon_grid_class.png) | **Grid Classes:** Grid classes provide separation between independent utility grids, allowing multiple systems to coexist without interference. This enables modular designs and supports advanced network configurations. |
| | **Socket Support:** Energy sockets enable per-tile side connections, meaning each side of a block can have its own unique connection state. These configurations can be dynamically updated through scripts, providing flexibility for automation and custom behavior. |
| ![Commands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/northwesttrees-gaming/CCTVCraft5Utility/refs/heads/main/modpages/github/github_icon_commands.png) | **Modding Commands:** The mod provides a set of modding commands that let you tap into the same internal systems we use for our own blocks. These range from simple operations, such as configuring NBT variables, to more complex mechanics like transferring energy and fluids between blocks. |
